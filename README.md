# Progressive Multiple Sequence Alignment

This Python script performs progressive multiple sequence alignment using pair-wise sequence alignment and profile alignment. It takes user-provided protein sequences, applies the alignment algorithms, and outputs the aligned sequences.


## Introduction

Progressive multiple sequence alignment is a common technique used in bioinformatics to align multiple biological sequences, such as protein sequences, in order to identify conserved regions and infer evolutionary relationships. This script utilizes the dynamic programming-based pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm for individual sequences and then combines these alignments to generate a final multiple sequence alignment.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the provided `alignment_script.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `alignment_script.py` file.

4. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python alignment_script.py
